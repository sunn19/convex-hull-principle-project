* The data, all.gbk.tar.gz, are downloaded from NCBI in March, 2020 : ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Viruses/.

* naturalvectordna.m: compute 12-dim Natural Vector.

* intersection.m: solve the LP problem, which is used to prove separation between two convex hulls.

* separating_hyperplane.m: calculate the separating hyperplane (w^T*x+b=0) for two point sets.

* LDA_test.m and Lda1.m should be added in the same path, which are used to project high dimensional vector to 2-dim vector.
